I use `git` almost every day yet there are still a lot of powerful things that be done with it that I am not aware of. For example, the `git rebase` command, I only used it for moving an entire feature branch on top of another branch. Recently, I learned about `git rebase --onto`, a command to remove commits from your current branch or to change the parent branch of a feature branch.
