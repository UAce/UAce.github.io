    A chrome extension that is used to help users plan, monitor, control their YouTube usage.
    Essentially, it prompts the user for an estimated time they want to spend on Youtube and sends a 
    notification when the time is up. The user can choose to leave or continue watching videos but there 
    will be a gradual blur applied to all videos. This was done as part of a school project (Human-Computer Interaction). 
    The chrome extension is available here:<br>

    Native android mobile game where the player's only task is to eliminate monsters (shamelessly stolen) from MapleStory. 
    As they level up, players will acquire new skills, unlock new maps and encounter new monsters. If the player is lucky,
    they will encounter a boss. This was initially made as a joke but it turned out to be quite fun and a good experience.
    <br> <u>Tools used</u>: Android Studio, Java, GSON
